           <h2>Using stylesheets</h2>

           <p>
            After understanding basic HTML structure, we were introduced to how stylesheets 
            are utilized in websites by changing font sizes and colors, inserting images, utilizing
            padding and margins, and understanding floats.
            </p>

            <h2>Wireframes and Responsive design</h2>
 
            <p>
             We jumped into the pre-planning of web design in the form of wireframes, understanding how a 
             Web Designer can work better when given a visual represntation of what a client might be looking
             for in their website. We utilized <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma.com</a> for these Wireframes.
             </p>
             
             <p>
            After understanding how stylesheets are utilized we then jump over how a user might be interacting with
            our websites, whether it be on desktop or mobile. We looked into how we could solve this by using media
            queries that change the website based on the size of the screen.
             </p>
            <p>
            Wireframes really helped in making decisions on how the site should look like at smaller sizes.
            One was used to make this website.

            <h2>Tables and Forms</h2>
 
            <p>
            After a while we began delving into more complex uses of HTML such as tables and taking in information
            through the use of forms.
            </p>

            <p>
            Table while not to difficult to make, it is more of tedium, however, once you have it down you they aren't
            too difficult and you can make one like this:
            </p>
             
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan="4">
                        My table
                    </th>
                </tr>
                    
                <tr>
                    <td>Some</td>
                    <td>Stuff</td>
                    <td>Here</td>
                    <td>!!!!!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Some</td>
                    <td>Stuff</td>
                    <td>Here</td>
                    <td>!!!!!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Some</td>
                    <td>Stuff</td>
                    <td>Here</td>
                    <td>!!!!!</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>
            Next we used forms to take in information and do something with it.
            </p>
            
            <fieldset>
                <legend>
                    Your info:
                </legend>

                <label for="firstName">
                    Name:
                    <input type="text" name="fname" id="firstName" required placeholder="First Name" />

                </label>

                <label for="lastName">
                    Last Name:
                    <input type="text" name="lname" id="lastName" required placeholder="Last Name" />

                </label>

                <label for="email">
                    Email:
                    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required placeholder="Email@Example.com" />

                </label>

                <input type="button" value="Submit" />

                <p class="no">
                *doesn't do anything
                </p>

            </fieldset>
 
            <p>
            Whether it be setting up an account or taking a reservation forms have many uses that
            later courses like my <strong>C# Programming II</strong> touch on
            </p>

            <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
 
            <p>
            We touched on Bootstrap near the end of the semester, and it makes sense as to why
            as it simplifies everything that we had learned in this course. However, it was understanding each individual part
            of HTML and CSS that made Bootstrap so simple to use. Without first understanding the foundation how could you know what to look for?
            </p>

            <p>
                I personally liked the use of Bootstrap and look forward to using it in future projects.
