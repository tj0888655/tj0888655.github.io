		<p>The name is Timoteo Jinks, or Tim for short, just an average dude doing things and learning from them.</p>

		<p>I don't do a whole lot outside of work, I mostly play 
		video games in my spare time and dabble into some pixel art.</p> 

		<p>Over the summer I decided to take some summer classes at OTC, Biology and Trigonometery,
		a tough duo I managed to take down.I was also introduced to an intersting program over the summer
		called Smack Studio, which allows me to take pixel art I have made and put into playable characters.</p><br/>
