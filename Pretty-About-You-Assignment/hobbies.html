			<h2 class="banner">Video Games</h2>
			
			<p>I play a variety of games but here lately I have been play a lot of rouge-like games.
			Rouge-like games are interesting in the way they are designed, you start a "run" collect items, power-ups, etc. and 
			play through until you meet an endgame objective or lose alltogeher.</p>

			<p>What's neat about rouge-likes though is that each play through is generated differently than the last,
			so no 2 runs will ever be "exactly" the same.</p>

			<p>Here's a few that I have been playing through:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The Binding of Issac: Repentance</li>
				<li>Slay the Spire</li>
				<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
			
			</ul>

				</ul>

			<h2 class="banner">Pixel Art</h2>

			<p>As well as playing video games I tend to like the style that the retro games were limited to.
			So much so that I have kinda delved into making what is called "Pixel Art", which is art that mimics 
			the the classic look of retro games from console like the NES and SNES.</p>

			<p>Though I am still learning how to improve, I have been having fun just playing around with Aesprite (an art application)
			and making some sprites.</p>
