                        <p>
                            I had a great experience with Happy Tails I booked for my dog. The staff was friendly and
                            professional, and they took good care of my furry friend. They sent me updates and photos every 
                            day, and I could tell my dog was having fun with the other pets. The resort was clean and spacious, 
                            and they had plenty of amenities for the animals. My dog came back happy and healthy, and I 
                            would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable pet resort.

                            I had a wonderful experience!! The staff was friendly and attentive, and they
                            took great care of my dog. He enjoyed playing with the other dogs, swimming in the pool, and relaxing
                            in the cozy bed. The resort was clean and spacious, and they had a lot of amenities for the pets. I 
                            also loved the daily updates and photos they sent me. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants 
                            to pamper their furry friend!
