Who am I?

The name is Timoteo Jinks, or Tim for short, just an average dude doing things and learning from them. I don't do a whole lot outside of work, I mostly play 
video games in my spare time and dabble into some pixel art. Over the summer I decided to take some summer classes at OTC, Biology and Trigonometery,
a tough duo I managed to take down. I was also introduced to an intersting program over the summer, called Smack Studio, which allows me to take pixel art
I have made and put into playable characters.

Hobbies

Video Games

I play a variety of games but here lately I have been play a lot of rouge-like games.
Rouge-like games are interesting in the way they are designed, you start a "run" collect items, power-ups, etc. and 
play through until you meet an endgame objective or lose alltogeher.

What's neat about rouge-likes though is that each play through is generated differently than the last, so no 2 runs will ever be "exactly the same.

Here's a few that I have been playing through:
	The Binding of Issac: Repentance
	Slay the Spire
	Vampire Survivors 

Pixel Art

As well as playing video games I tend the like to the style that the retro games were limited to. So much so that I have kinda delved into making 
what is called "Pixel Art", which is art that mimics the the classic look of retro games from console like the NES and SNES.

Though I am still learning how to improve, I have been having fun just playing around with Aesprite (an art application) and making some sprites.
