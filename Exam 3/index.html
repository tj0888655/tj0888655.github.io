                WELCOME TO THE
                RAILROAD HISTORICAL MUSEUM INC.
            </h1>

            <p>
                We are a nonprofit museum dedicated to the preservation of Railroad History and the heritage of the
                past, educating present and future generations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our museum is located in the St. Louis San-Francisco Locomotive No.4524, Burlington Baggage Car, Chicago
                and Northwestern Commuter Car and Burlington Northern Caboose, as well as the new Max Jahn Depot. The
                depot is a replica of an 1890s-era rural depot, based on the original prints from the depot at Elsinore,
                MO.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have artifacts, equipment, photos, paintings and much more from the St. Louis San-Francisco Railroad
                and other Railroads.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. We also have videos of Steam and Diesel
                Trains, and a Model Train Layout. You are welcome to explore the Frisco Locomotive 4524, Commuter Car,
                Caboose, and the depot.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are in Grant Beach Park with access to a public pool, playground and picnic area. We are also on City
                Utilities Bus Route.
            </p>

            <p>
                The staff at the museum are volunteers, many of whom have a connection to the railroad industry and can
                answer your questions.
            </p>
