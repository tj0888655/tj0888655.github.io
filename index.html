            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                Hello!! My Name is <em>Timoteo Jinks</em> and I am a student attending at
                Ozark Technical Community College (OTC).
            </p>

            <p>

                This website serves as a product of what I have learned
                this
                semester in my <strong>CIS - 130 Web Development I</strong> class.
            </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>

            <p>
                This would be my 3rd semester at OTC and I am currently aiming for my
                Associate's in the Computer Science Degree Program. I have taken some of the more Degree focused
                courses such as <strong>CIS - 151 C# Programming II</strong>, <strong>CIS - 250 Database and
                    Query</strong>, and of course
                <strong>CIS - 130 Web Development I</strong>. 
                
                
            </p>


            <p>
                There was a lot to take in this semester and I would like
                to <a href="Showcase.html">showcase what I
                    have learned</a>. I will be focusing on mainly Web Development content in this presentation.
            </p>

            <h2>My future goals and Aspirations</h2>

            <p>
                So far, my graduation date looks to be set for <strong>Fall 2025</strong>, but this semester I expect to
                be ceritfied in C#, SQL, and HTML and CSS. I hope that I can use what I have learned in this semester
                in the field somehow when I graduate.
            </p>

            <p>
                I do believe that practice makes perfect and what better way to
                practice than to just do it?
            </p>
